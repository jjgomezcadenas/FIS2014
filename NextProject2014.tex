\section{\bf Introduction}
\label{sec.intro}
The goal of this document is to provide a full justification of the costs requested to the 2014 I+D+i program
``Challenges of society''. This document has been prepared as a complement of the ``Scientific report'' (Memoria científica y técnica) submitted to the 2014 I+D+i program
``Challenges of society'' and is not intended to replace it, but to provide further information to the ministry and evaluators. 


\section{\bf Costs of the NEXT project}
\label{next.costs}

\input{tbs/NEW.tex}
\input{tbs/NEXT100.tex}
\input{tbs/INFRA.tex}

\subsection{Costs of computing, calibration and slow controls}
Computing is estimated in 69,521 \euro\ that will be covered by the AdG grant. The costs of the slow control (18,271 \euro) and the calibration (60,700 \euro, cost dominated by the need to purchase special radioactive sources for calibration) are assigned to FIS2014. 

\subsection{Total costs equipment, NEXT construction}
The total costs in equipment of NEXT construction are summarised in table  \ref{tab.TotalE}. They totalise about 4.6 million \euro\ including the xenon gas (1.1 million \euro). The {\bf external} contributions to the project (e.g, the money that does not come from the spanish science system)
add to 1,286,475 \euro\ ,  a figure slightly higher than the co-funding of 1,279,737  \euro\ 
requested in this project.

\subsection{Costs of construction, personnel and travel to LSC}
\begin{table}[h!]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Subproject &	Construction &	Personnel  &	Travel& Total\\
\hline
COORD (IFIC)	& 859,091 &	600,000 &	181,000 &	1,640,091 \\

 \hline\hline
\end{tabular}  
\caption{Costs of NEXT construction, personnel and travel to LSC.}
\label{tab.CostsTotal}
\end{center}
\end{table} 

The total costs of construction, personnel and travel to the LSC amounts to 
{\bf 2,450,737 \euro}. The costs are distributed in three subprojects, called COORD (coordination, IFIC), 
ENG (engineering, UPV) and CALREC (calibration and reconstruction, US). The distribution of costs per subproject is detailed in table \ref{tab.CostsTotal}. Notice that the construction funds requested
by IFIC are matched by those provided by the AdG, and the construction funds requested by the 
UPV are matched by those provided by the USA groups. All the personnel funds are matched by 
funds provided by the AdG. The personnel from the co-ordinated project at the LSC will be matched
by personnel from the international collaboration. 

\subsection{Common fund}

The operation and maintenance costs of NEXT will be covered by contributions of all the groups to a common fund (CF). The CF is being implemented in 2015 and will be firm from 2016 onwards. The CF is implemented by charging an annual quota (2,500 \euro) per Ph.D in the group. Table \ref{tab.CFD} gives the distribution of PH.Ds in the collaboration (as of September 2014) and their contribution to the CF. The total is 100 k\euro\ per year, which is the right order of magnitude to cover for common expenses (including supplies, cleaning material, maintenance of subsystems, nitrogen and argon gas, and replacements of expensive supplies such as gaskets) and to afford modest improvements to the systems. 

\begin{table}[h!]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}
\hline
Group &	number of Ph.D & 	Contribution \\
\hline
IFIC &	10	& 25,000 \\
UPV	& 3 &	7,500 \\
US	& 2	& 5,000 \\
UAM	  & 2 & 	5,000 \\
UNIZAR	& 6	& 15,000 \\
Portugal 	& 6	& 15,000 \\
Russia	& 3	& 7,500 \\
Colombia	& 3	& 7,500 \\
USA	& 5 & 	12,500 \\
\hline
Total & 40& 100,000 \\
 \hline\hline
\end{tabular}  
\caption{Contributions to NEXT common fund.}
\label{tab.CFD}
\end{center}
\end{table} 

In this project we require funds to contribute to the NEXT CF, corresponding to 3 years (2016, 2017 and 2018). The contributions to 2015 can be covered with remaining funds from CUP. The contribution is
37,500 \euro\ per year, thus a total of 112,500 \euro. 
		
\section{\bf The R\&D \BATA\ program}
\label{sec.bata}
The priority of this project is the construction, commissioning and operation of the NEXT experiment. However, the greatest potential of NEXT is, in fact, its capability to become the {\bf leading World experiment} of the field.

If no discovery is made by the current generation of experiments, the search for \bbonu\ processes will require detectors of larger mass (at least 1 ton), good resolution and extremely low specific background. The \HPXE\ technology has the potential to provide the most sensitive detector in the ton scale, by scaling the detector to a mass in the range of the ton and adding additional handles to further suppress the background. 

One of the most promising possibilities is to develop the technology to unambiguously tag the barium ion produced in the xenon decay, $Xe \rightarrow Ba^{++} + 2 e$. The conceptual idea to tag $Ba^{+}$ is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig.levelscheme2}. A ``blue'' laser of wavelength 493.54 nm excites (``pumps'') the S state, inducing $S \rightarrow P$~transitions, with a lifetime of $\sim$ 10 ns. About 30 \% of the times the \TwoP\ states decay to the state \TwoD, emitting ``red'' (649.86 nm) fluorescence in a characteristic time of 30 ns. The state \TwoD\ is metastable, but a second laser of suitable wavelength (2051.66 nm) can be used to induce the transition to the ground state (this is known as ``deshelving'').  The whole cycle takes less than 50 ns, and therefore several millions of red fluorescence photons can be emitted by a single ion. 

Of course, the practical application of this beautiful conceptual idea is by no means easy, and in fact, it has been shown to be extremely difficult in liquid xenon by the work of the EXO collaboration. However, it may be feasible in an \HPXE\ detector, where a number of fortunate conditions may occur. These conditions are: a) charge reduction of the emitted barium ion, from $Ba^{++}$~to $Ba^{+}$, which can be induced by collisions with xenon atoms, or by the addition of a suitable quencher, such as TEA, as demonstrated by Sinclair et al\footnote{Sinclair.}, b) ``trapping'' of the barium ion ``in situ'' by the surrounding Xe atoms, which result in a very low drift velocity for the ion; c) location of the ion, done by reconstructing the event vertex. 

All the above needs to be demonstrated with a systematic R\&D program, which must also address many other experimental issues such as pressure broadening of the laser, filtering of Rayleigh scattering, etc. Most importantly, such an experimental program must be carried out by an interdisciplinary group, combining the experience in laser spectroscopy and atomic physics, with the experience in \HPXE\ instrumentation.

The on-going collaboration between the IFIC (and other groups of NEXT) and the Center for Pulsed Lasers (CLPU)\footnote{\href{http://www.clpu.es}{http://www.clpu.es}}, a national facility dedicated to ultra-intense lasers research and development has made possible to create precisely the interdisciplinary team needed for a successful R\&D program, which can culminate in a ``Barium-tagging Experiment with a Xenon TPC'' (BEXT). We are currently preparing a white paper which describes the theoretical grounds and details the experimental program to be developed. 

Clearly the construction of a ton-scale \HPXE\ detector implementing a full \BATA\ technology is a very challenging enterprise. On the other hand, we believe that the incremental approach devised by the NEXT collaboration will also work in this case. The construction of the NEW detector is progressing without significant problems thanks to the expertise and know-how gained during DEMO phase, and we expect that NEXT-100 will fully benefit from the experience gained with NEW. Similarly, the \BATA\ technology could be demonstrated in the period of 4 years corresponding to this project,by approaching the problem step by step. 

This is possible only thanks to the collaboration between NEXT and the CLPU.
CLPU is the centre of reference in Spain regarding laser technology, and takes active part in several international and national projects. CLPU enters this co-ordinated project with a full time physicists, who will lead the subproject, Dr. Alicia V. Carpentier who has a well recognised international trajectory in laser-matter interaction. Moreover, CLPU considers this project of high priority and consequently will offer the collaboration of all the scientific department. This consists of a multidisciplinar team with broad experience in laser technology and development, and laser-matter interaction. 

Furthermore, CLPU will support this project with some of the already operating laser systems in its installation. This is extremely important because such systems usually cost of the order of several hundreds of thousand euros which is totally out of the economical scope of this project. The human resources needed to operate the laser systems will be provided by CLPU as well. We will  also like to mention that the small components needed for the construction of the small prototypes will be afforded by the already established NEXT-CLPU collaboration (funds from AdG). In addition, the CLPU and IFIC groups will apply for  \emph{EXPLORA} grants in the next calls.

The different objectives of this subproject are:


\subsection{The \BATA\ program}
The R\&D of the Barium Tagging (\BATA) program includes:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{img/levelscheme2.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig.levelscheme2} Level scheme for BaTa with an infrared deshelving laser.} 
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Proof of principle experiment with Ba ions generated by means of an electrical discharge.}
In a first round of experiments we will excite resonantly the S$\leftrightarrow$P transition of Ba$^+$ ions generated by an electrical discharge between two barium electrodes and will collect the fluorescence signal of the P$\rightarrow$D transition (see Figure.\,\ref{fig.levelscheme}). Although this generation method is not ideal because several different species different from Ba ions will be generated, e.g., molecules like BaO or clusters, it does not need a major technological development. It is expected that this initial set of experiments will provide valuable information about the population dynamics in Ba$^+$ ions, and the influence of the different homogenous and in-homogenous broadening mechanisms. It is important to mention that the laser system required for this objective will be provided by the CLPU, and the rest of the material by the ongoing collaboration NEXT-CLPU (e.g., AdG grant).

	\item \textbf{Proof of principle experiment with Ba ions generated by an ion source to be developed.}	
In this objective, in order to get a better approximation of the final conditions of NEXT experiment and with the financial support of a future EXPLORA project, a source of ions will be designed and constructed. This ion source will be based on selective ionisation and mass spectrometry techniques, and it will allow a perfect selection of a target specie. Once the source is ready we will repeat the set of experiments of the previous objective but without any parasitic contribution of unwanted compounds. 
	
	\item \textbf{Proof of principle experiment with Ba ions generated by means of a developed ion source and with a magneto trap.}	
Once the ion source is in operation, in a following objective, we will develop a magneto trap for Ba$^+$  ions. This trap will allow us to have an excellent degree of control over the experimental conditions and to approach the conditions of NEXT. For instance we will carry out different measurements comparing the collected fluorescence signal as a function of the pressure of the Ba$^+$ ions and the pressure of the surrounding environment. These measurements are mandatory because the population dynamics is really sensitive to pressure, i.e., to collisions. 
	
	\item \textbf{Proof of principle experiment with an additional laser for deshelving the D state.}
A possible scenario is that the collisional induced decay between the metastable state D and the ground state S is either not effective or too slow for obtaining an appreciable fluorescence signal. In this situation the population is trapped in the metastable state D  and the fluorescence cycle can not be closed. To avoid this difficulty our approach will be to use a second laser to induce a two photon transition, one photon is forbidden by selection rules, between the states D and S (see Figure.\,\ref{fig.levelscheme2}). This laser must have a wavelength of around 4.1\,$\mu$m which is not easily accesible by commercial laser systems. Our objective is therefore to develop a laser system at this wavelength, and to repeat the experimental matrix defined in previous objectives with two lasers.
	
\end{itemize}

\section{\BATA\ R\&D costs}
\label{bata.costs}

\subsection{R\&D requirements}
The R\&D costs requested to this project are modest. They are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf A contribution to build an infra-red laser}. The AdG and funds from CLPU cover most of the items needed for the R\&D in 2015 and we fully expect that the EXPLORA project (plus one or more H2020 projects) will cover the R\&D program for the subsequent year. However, a much needed and not fully covered item is a (infra-) red laser of 4.1\,$\mu$m. Such system is needed in our experiments to enhance the transitions between the meta-stable D state in the Ba+ ion and the ground state. On the other hand, it is important to remark that this specific wavelength is not easily accesible by  commercial laser systems, and in fact, there is keen interest in the laser community to develop such laser, due to the fact that this wavelength is not absorbed by the atmosphere and therefore presents many different technological applications. We expect to be able to patent the design and believe it is a clear case of obvious and important industrial return. 
\item {\bf A modest contribution to acquire small equipment and fungible at UPV and US}.
\item {\bf One FPI grant}, to work at the CLPU, in the \BATA\ program. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{R\&D costs}
We require a total of 150,000 \euro\ for this program. The bulk of the cost is the development of the infra-red laser (100,000 \euro). To this, we add 25,000 \euro\ for small equipment and fungibles at the US and at the UPV. 

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec.conclu}

This report summarises the scientific and economic data relevant to the NEXT project, including the R\&D \BATA\ program. The report fully describes the co-funding request to the I+D+i program of ``Challenges of society''. In addition to its scientific excellence, we would like to remark that NEXT is unique in the area of particle physics. As an international collaboration being developed in our national underground laboratory (LSC) and lead by spanish groups, it brings to Spain considerable know-how and external funding. In particular, it is currently the only example of particle-physics experiment in Spain having obtained an advanced grant of the ERC (granted to the spokesperson and PI of this project), 

Of particular interest is also the collaboration with CLPU, which expands the scope of this project to a very interdisciplinar field, including atomic physics and laser-matter interaction. The prospects of industrial returns in the \BATA\ program appear very high, in particular thanks to the development of infra-red laser technology and controlled ions sources, areas with an increasing number of industrial and scientific applications. 

Last but not least, the NEXT experiment, and/or the future BEXT experiment, including the \BATA\ technology have the clear potential of leading a major scientific discovery.
