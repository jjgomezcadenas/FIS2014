\subsubsection*{Personnel requested for the BaTa subproject}

In order to reach the objectives of the BaTa subproject we request the a technical engineer to help developing the infrared laser.

The infrared laser sites in a very unfavorable region of the infrared spectrum. This is the reason why there are almost no commercial lasers at this wavelengths.
Thus, a full-time three-years contract for a technical engineer is requested. This technician will collaborate in the development of the theoretical and experimental studies needed, as well as in the construction of the prototypes. It is interesting to point out that the formation in laser technology that this technician will acquire during this period will be extremely valuable, since there is a lack of people with such qualifications in Spain.
