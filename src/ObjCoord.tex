\subsubsection*{Objectives of the COORD subproject}

The specific objectives of the COORD subproject are described below. The cronogram in Figure \ref{fig.crono} illustrates the temporal progress of the objectives. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
{\bf  Construction of the infrastructures at LSC}

The working platform, seismic pedestal and lead castle was designed by a collaboration between UPV and IFIC during 2012 and 2013 and the systems have been commissioned at the LSC in 2014. The remaining missing items are the radon suppression system and the clean tent, which will be installed at the LSC during Q1 2015. 

\item {\bf Construction of the NEW and NEXT-100 pressure vessels}

The NEW and NEXT-100 pressure vessels, shown in Figure \ref{fig:PV} were designed to withstand pressures in excess of 20 bar, and to operate with negligible losses at 15 bar. They are built using a 316Ti alloy of low activity ($\sim$0.2 mBq/kg for the thorium series and 
the uranium series, as measured by our screening campaign). 

The design of the PV was a collaboration between IFIC and LBNL groups. Manufacturing has involved several companies in Spain and has benefited from a CEDETI grant. The remaining activities in the project (see cronogram), are the construction and installation of the Inner Copper Shield (ICS) for both NEW and NEXT-100, as well as the installation and commissioning of the PVs at the LSC.

\item {\bf Installation and commissioning of the Gas System for NEW and NEXT-100 at the LSC}

The gas system must be capable of pressurising, circulating, purifying, and depressurising the detector with xenon and other gases with negligible loss, and without damage to the detector. The probability of any substantial loss of enriched xenon must be minimized. 

The most vulnerable component of the gas system is the re-circulation compressor.
The enriched \Xe\ used in NEXT 100 project is very expensive and therefore the compressor to move the gas through the re-circulation loop
must have sufficient redundancy to minimise the probability of failure and leakage. 
Furthermore, to preserve the purity of the gas all metal to metal seals must be used. During 2014, a  compressor manufactured by SERA which satisfies this specifications \footnote{\texttt http://www.sera-web.com} was identified.
This compressor is made with metal-to-metal seals on all the wetted surfaces. The gas is moved through the system by a triple stainless steel diaphragm. Between each
of the diaphragms there is a sniffer port to monitor for gas leakages. In the event of a leakage automatic emergency shutdown can be initiated.
Other elements of the gas system include an automatic recovery system 
to evacuate the chamber in a case of an emergency condition, and molecular traps (getters) to clean the gas. 

The  system has been designed and extensively tested during the R\&D phase of the project. All the equipment (including the compressor, emergency recovery and recirculation loop) has been order during 2014. The gas system will be installed at the LSC during Q1 2015. 

\item {\bf Construction of the field cage, light tube, HVFT and EL grids of NEW and NEXT-100}

The field cage (FC) produces an uniform electric ($\sim$ 300 V/cm) field inside the NEXT detectors that drifts the ionisation electron to the anode, where they are further accelerated in the electric field produced between a pair of transparent grids, called the electroluminescent (EL) grids. 

The main body of the field cage is a high density polyethylene (HDPE) cylindrical shell with a 2.5\,cm wall thickness.  The drift region will consist of OFHC copper strips connected with low background resistors.  The light tube consists of thin sheets of teflon, coated with tetraphenyl butadiene (TPB) wavelength shifter to shift the UV light produced in xenon to the blue region, around 450 nm.  A high-voltage feedthrough (HVFT) in the cathode and another one in the anode, allow the definition of the voltages. The cathode HVFT is designed to withstand up to 100 kV, and the HVFT of the anode to withstand up to 40 kV. The design of the HVFT, identical for NEW and NEXT-100 improve those that were built for DEMO by the Texas A\&M group. The field cage and grids of NEW and NEXT-100 are also identical, to a scale 1:2. The grids use a stainless steel mesh with pitch 0.5 mm and wire diameter 30 microns, which results in an open area of 90\%. Except for the size, the grids of NEW and NEXT-100 are also identical. 

The construction of the NEW FC (NFC) is under way in 2014. The HDPE body is being manufactured by the AIMPLAS company (Valencia). The HVFT and the grids are being manufactured at Texas. The  NFC will be commissioned inside the NEW PV at the LSC in Q1 2015. Evaluation of performance will allow us to decide any possible improvements for the NEXT-100 FC (N100FC) during Q2 2015. The construction of the N100FC will proceed in the same way than NFC (body fabricated in Valencia, HVFT and grids in the USA) during 2016. Commissioning of the N100FC will proceed during Q1 2017. Evaluation of performance during Q2 2017. Any needed upgrades will be introduced during Q3, Q4 2017, to guarantee stable operation during 2018.  

\item {\bf Construction of the NEW/NEXT-100 energy planes (WP5)}

The energy measurement will be provided by the detection of EL light via PMTs, which will also record the scintillation light needed for $t_0$. Those PMTs will be located behind a transparent cathode.

\end{figure}
%%%%%

A total of 60 low-background, high-QE PMTs, model R11410-10 from Hamamatsu covering 32.5\% of the cathode area constitute the energy plane of NEXT-100 (N100EP, Figure \ref{fig:EnergyPlane}, left). The R11410-10 are large tubes, with a 3'' photocathode and low levels of  activity of the order of 1 mBq per unit in the Uranium and Thorium series. The QE of the R11410-10 model is around 25\% both in the VUV and in the blue region. The  PMT coverage is 33\%, enough to guarantee detection of S1 in most of the energy spectrum and to measure the energy with good resolution.

PMTs are sealed into individual pressure resistant, vacuum tight copper enclosures (cans) coupled to 
sapphire windows. The cans are all connected via individual pressure resistant, vacuum tight tubing conduits to a central manifold. The PMT system is maintained at vacuum.

The NEW energy plane (NEP, Figure \ref{fig:EnergyPlane}, right) is identical to the N100EP, except for the number of sensors. With 12 PMT cans (20\% of NEXT-100 sensors) it needs to cover an area of about half the radius, and provides therefore the same coverage. 

The NEP is currently under construction at IFIC. The PMT can design have been validated with prototypes, and production of the parts has started. The NEP will be assembled at LSC during Q1 2015. Evaluation of performance will allow us to decide any possible improvements for N100EP during Q2 2015. The construction of the N100EP will proceed using the PMT can production line developed for NEP. Commissioning of the N100EP will proceed during Q1 2017. Evaluation of performance during Q2 2017. Any needed upgrades will be introduced during Q3, Q4 2017, to guarantee stable operation during 2018. 

%The NEXT-100 energy plane will be built also at IFIC. Construction will start immediately after the NEW engineering run, and will benefit from the methodology currently being developed for NEW, which includes: a) testing of PMTs; b) manufacturing of PMT cans; c) brazing of sapphire windows to PMT cans; d) cleaning and coating with TPB of PMT cans; e) coupling of PMTs to window, using certified optical glue; f) installation of cans in the vacuum-tight, support plate.

\item  {\bf  Construction of the NEW/NEXT-100 tracking planes (WP6)}:

\end{figure}
%%%%%%%

In NEXT the tracking function is provided by a plane of multi-pixel photon counters (MPPCs or SiPMs) operating as a light-pixels and located behind the transparent EL grids. The MPPCs will be manufactured by SENSL. This radiopure devices has an area of 1mm$^2$, very low dark current and very large 
particle detection efficiency (PDE) in the blue region, close to 50\%. We have measured the spread in gain between the sensors to be less than 4\%, while the average in gain is close to $\times10^6$. 

The MPPCs are mounted in Dice Boards (DB). The original design, used for NEXT-DEMO, was based in   {\em cuflon} (PTFE fixed to a copper back plane) boards. During 2012 and 2013, a more advanced design, based in Kapton Dice Boards (KDBs) has been developed and fully tested. The KDBs host 65 SiPMs (rather than 16), are much more radiopure than the  cuflon DB, since they have no connector, and introduce less electronic noise thanks to better routing of traces. 

Figure \ref{fig.db2} shows the tracking plane of NEXT-100 (N100TP) and that of NEW (NTP) together with the KDBs and the original cuflon DB. 
NTP is identical to N100TP, except for the number of sensors. 

The NTP is currently under construction at IFIC. The KDB production has been validated and prototypes have demonstrated excellent performance. The NTP will be assembled at LSC during Q1 2015. Evaluation of performance will allow us to decide any possible improvements for N100TP during Q2 2015. The construction of the N100TP will proceed using the KDB production line developed for NTP. Commissioning of the N100TP will proceed during Q1 2017. Evaluation of performance during Q2 2017. Any needed upgrades will be introduced during Q3, Q4 2017, to guarantee stable operation during 2018. 

%The tracking plane of NEW is also being manufactured at IFIC, and the tracking plane of NEXT-100 will follow the same protocol consisting in: a) production of KDBs; b) testing of KDB functionality; c) cleaning and mounting in the tracking plane support plate.
