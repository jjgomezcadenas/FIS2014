The different goals described in the previous sections are integrated in the NEXT Project Management Plan (PMP). 
The PMP coordinates the construction of the NEW and NEXT-100 detectors. It is under the direct supervision of the Spokesperson (SP) and the Project Manager (PM). The PM of NEXT is Dr. I. Liubarsky, part of the IFIC group.

The PMP defines a set of Working Packages (WP) and follows the progress of each one, monitors deliverables and dead lines and keeps track of invested resources including personnel. It also identifies potential show-stoppers and synergies (and possible conflicts) between the different projects and optimises the sharing of resources. Figure \ref{fig.Gantt} shows an example of the Gantt chart for the whole NEW project, up to installation at the LSC. 
The objectives defined for the different sub projects match the various WP in the PMP. 

The methodology of each WP includes: a) the definition of the associated tasks; b) the identification of the resources needed; c) the temporal organisation of the tasks; d) the definition of milestones and the deliverables associated to them. 

Figure \ref{Fig:NFC} summarises the WP for the NFC as an example of the protocol followed for each system (energy plane, tracking plane,etc). The system is divided in a set of subsystems (HHV Feedthrough, EL Mesh, Cathode, Anode, Buffer, Body, etc). An engineering design for the construction of each subsystem is produced, if needed after one or more prototypes. Next, procurement (who builds it) is identified, and the production period defined. Individual tests of the produced parts are performed, before one proceeds to system tests of the assembly. After successful completion of tests, the system is cleaned with an special protocol to eliminate any surface radioactivity, shipped to LSC and mounted inside the PV. A new set of tests is performed there before starting commissioning. 

In the case of the NFC, the HHV Feedthrough, EL Mesh, Cathode and Anode parts are produced and tested by Texas A\&M university. The HDPE (polyethylene) body, resistor chain, buffer and light tube are produced at IFIC, through the manufacturing company AIMPLAS. Once each individual part is tested, we proceed to ``dirty assembly'' (e.g., parts have not been cleaned for radio purity) and perform functional testing (breakdown voltages, sparks, stability), before disassembling the parts again, shipping to LSC, cleaning and perform ``clean assembly'' and retest. 

The construction of NEXT-100 benefits very much from the incremental experience acquired during the project. Thus, the protocol for NEW construction was defined after assessing the successes and difficulties in the construction of the DEMO detector. The methodology has been refined to build NEW, and applies in a direct way to NEXT-100. Following the example of the field cage, the distribution of tasks between Texas and IFIC will be the same, and the manufacturing of the different parts uses the same tools and protocols developed for NEW. 

The fact that NEW allow us to set up a chain production that can be then used for NEXT-100 allows for a very robust approach to construction. For example, the construction of the NEXT-100 energy plane requires the production of 60 PMT cans. Each can is composed of a copper body, brazed to a sapphire window. The windows are coated first with ITO (for electric conductivity) then with TPB (to shift the UV light to blue) and bolted to the support plate, so that the system is vacuum tight. 

To set the PMT can production chain, we started by producing a set of prototype cans, which allowed us to improve the initial design (for example using brazing rather than the initial idea of CF gaskets) and certify correct operation. Test were conducted to ensure good light transmittance (this implied a lengthy search to find the optimal optical glue to couple the PMT quartz window to the PMT can sapphire window), vacuum tightness and no sparks at the bases. Finally, each one of the parts (copper stock, brazing stock, bolts, windows) were screened to ensure radio purity. The companies in charge of manufacturing the PMT cans, procuring the sapphire window, and coating the window with ITO were identified, costs secured, and delivery times specified. The protocol to coat the windows with TPB (at the italian laboratory of Gran Sasso) was also specified. With all the above elements, the PMT can chain is defined, and the exercised with the production of 12 PMT cans for NEW. We expect to identify and correct any problem, and optimise the procedure during the process, which has already started. Once certified, the production of 60 PMT cans for NEXT-100 can proceed in a robust and predictable way. 

Analogously the tracking plane subsystems include: The sensors themselves (SiPMs), which we have extensively tested. The flexible kapton boards (KDBs), whose design has already been certified, after a successful pre-production. The in-chamber cables which connect from the KDB to the feedthrough. The out-camber cables, which connect to the electronics. The feedthrough itself, which has already been successfully tested, showing a negligible leak rate. Almost every component of the NEXT tracking plane is a new technological development, including the KDBs which allow large matrices of SIPMs to be used as optical pixels and the feedthrough, which uses an innovative, yet affordable (and radio clean) technology. On the other hand, we have experienced few problems, and the system scales up nicely to the larger NEXT-100 detector (in short: we just need to mass-produced more KDBs and more feedthroughs). 

From the methodological point of view, the commissioning and operation of NEW is also an essential ingredient for the success of NEXT-100. The operation of NEW will allow us to: a) fully test the dynamics of detector and its stability (as we have done with DEMO, after more than two years of continuous operation); test the entire signal chain, from sensor to digitisation; c) calibrate the detector and assess its performance. Such {\em system} evaluation will allow to identify and correct any design or implementation problem before starting the construction of NEXT-100.
