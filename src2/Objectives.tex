\paragraph{General objectives.}
The overall objectives of this research proposal are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Construction, commissioning and operation of the NEW and NEXT-100 detectors, during a period of 4 years, from 2015 to 2018.
\item Demonstrate the feasibility of barium tagging in a HPXe, performing a systematic set of small, focused, proof-of-concept experiments. As part of this objective, an infrared laser using innovative technology will be developed. 
\end{enumerate}
  
The COORD subproject leads the construction of the NEW and NEXT-100 detectors, while the ENG subproject leads the deployment of the electronics, DAQ and slow controls. The CALREC subproject leads the calibration of the detector. The R\&D for barium tagging is led by the BATA subproject (CLPU), with the participation of all the groups.   

The objectives presented in this project are very well aligned to the Spanish program for science, as demonstrated by the fact that NEXT has been supported by the CONSOLIDER-INGENIO project CUP. The support of the AdG/ERC makes it clear that the projects suits perfectly well the goals of H2020. NEXT is a CERN recognised experiment and has been listed by NSAC\footcite{NLDBD} as one of the key \bbonu\ experiments in the field, and the one with best future prospects.
