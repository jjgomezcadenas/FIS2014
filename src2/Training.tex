The IFIC group has currently 2 soon-to-be new doctors (J. Martin-Albo and F. Monrabal, who present their Ph.Ds in October 2014) and 4 graduate students (Lorca, Serra, Simo and Nebot), who will defend their Ph.D. thesis in 2015 (Lorca and Serra) and 2016 (Nebot and Simo). 

The PI of this project has advised a total of 11 students (De Fez, Lozano, Hernando, Cervera, Manel, Burguet, Tornero, Catala, Novella, Martin-Albo and Monrabal). De Fez, Lozano, Hernando and Cervera have obtained academic positions (Emirates, Granada, U. of Santiago and Valencia). Novella has been a Marie Curie fellow and has just re-joined the group with a R\&C. Burguet works in a software company developing internet products and Tornero, has a permeant position in medical physics (radiotherapy) and Catala, has continue his career as a teacher. Martin-Albo and Monrabal have already offers for post-doc position in the US.

The construction, commissioning and operation of NEXT is a great opportunity for graduate students, who can take since very early, leading roles in important parts of the experiment. In particular, we plan to enrol 2-3 students in the next few years, replacing those that graduate. The students will take instrumental responsibilities, working in the construction of the energy plane, tracking plane or field cage; they will participate in the commissioning of the detector and in the data taking. And they will take important roles in the analysis of the data. In addition of the PI, the group includes experience senior physicists, such as Dr. Sorel, the analysis convener who has already co-advised the Ph.D. of Catala. Other senior physicists in the group include Dr. Liubarsky, Dr. Yahlali and Dr. Novella.
