\paragraph{Objectives of the CALREC subproject.}

The specific objectives of this subproject are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf Photo-detectors calibration system}. Design, construction, commissioning and operation of a calibration system to estimate the gain and noise of the SiPM and PMT sensors of NEW and NEXT-100. 

\item {\bf Energy calibration system}. Design, construction, commissioning and operation of an energy calibration system with external radioactive sources for NEW and NEXT-100.

\item {\bf Position calibration system}. Design, construction, commissioning and operation of a position calibration system using the X-rays produced by a $^{83}$Rb source. 

%\item {\bf Xenon additives}. Development of a dedicated testing system to evaluate additives capable to improve the performance of pure xenon. 

\end{enumerate}
